        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Mark. I've been working the Information Technology/Engineering field since 2009, beginning
            as a Help Desk Technician, wading through Systems Engineering and Information Security, and am currently in
            the DevOps/Cloud/Platform Engineering stage of my career. Some of my primary focuses include codifying
            all-things-infrastructure, automating everything where possible (and prudent), and working with teams to
            act as a force multiplier to enhance their productivity and overall experience.</p>

        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of my work is not my work and is owned as intellectual property of the clients that I've
            worked with, so I have decided to create this website as a demonstration of capability using Pulumi, Google
            Cloud Platform, GitHub, and more! This is a living project and will be updated over time. The next update
            will likely include HTTPS support, but that requires a load balancer that I am not yet willing to pay for.</p>
